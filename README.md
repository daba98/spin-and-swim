Spin and Swim ([Google Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.die_bartmanns.spinnandfly)) is a fun little mobile game for Android. Make the little fish swim! But don't touch the obstacles! And beware, you have only one shot to set the direction!

How far can you make it?

This game looks rather simple but is astonishingly difficult. You have to tap at the exact right moment to let the little fish swim in its current direction tangentially to the spinning circle. If you hit the gap right in the middle you can collect shells which in turn can be used to unlock new characters.
